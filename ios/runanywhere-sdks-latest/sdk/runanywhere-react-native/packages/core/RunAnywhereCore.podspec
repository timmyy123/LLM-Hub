  # (shared with the Flutter plugin) via a path RELATIVE to the .mm file on

  # itself is NOT compiled directly — it is brought in via the wrapper's

  # translation unit and trip that guard — CocoaPods compiles every .mm matched
  # by source_files, and preserve_paths does NOT remove a file from compilation.
  # Exclude it from compiled sources: it still ships on disk via preserve_paths

  # user_target_xcconfig — flags that must reach the HOSTING APP target so the
  # commons proto ABIs survive into the final RunAnywhereAI dylib.
  #
  # Why: the RN C++ bridge resolves the VLM/STT/TTS/diffusion proto entry points
  # (e.g. cpp/HybridRunAnywhereCore+Voice.cpp → dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT,
  # "rac_vlm_stream_proto")) PURELY at runtime via dlsym — there is no link-time
  # reference. CocoaPods links the vendored static archive with a plain
  # `-l"rac_commons"`, which only pulls archive members that satisfy an
  # *undefined* symbol, so the linker dead-strips every dlsym-only proto object
  # (rac_vlm_*/rac_stt_*/rac_tts_*/diffusion). rac_llm_*/structured_output_*
  # survive only because they ARE referenced at link time. This mirrors how the
  # Flutter plugin keeps its FFI symbols (runanywhere.podspec user_target_xcconfig
  # uses -all_load + DEAD_CODE_STRIPPING=NO).
  #
  #   -force_load .../librac_commons.a  link EVERY object in the commons archive
  #        regardless of whether a symbol is referenced (targeted: only commons,
  #        not the whole app like -all_load). CocoaPods stages the vendored
  #        xcframework slice into ${PODS_XCFRAMEWORKS_BUILD_DIR}/RunAnywhereCore
  #        and the binary is librac_commons.a (linked as -l"rac_commons").
  #   -Wl,-export_dynamic  keep the force-loaded symbols in the dynamic symbol
  #        table so dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...) can still find them at runtime.
  #   DEAD_CODE_STRIPPING=NO  belt-and-suspenders: don't let the app target drop
  #        the now-linked-but-unreferenced proto objects.
