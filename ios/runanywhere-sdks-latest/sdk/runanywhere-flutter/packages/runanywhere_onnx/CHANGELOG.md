## [0.20.9] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- Version-aligned 0.20.9 release across all RunAnywhere SDKs; dev-analytics config baked into the native core at build time.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- Aligned the backend package and native artifact contract with RunAnywhere 0.20.0.

## [0.19.15] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Aligned public package metadata and native artifact staging with RunAnywhere 0.19.15.

## [0.19.13] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- Kept the Flutter plugin as a thin backend registration adapter by removing unused template MethodChannel methods.
- Aligned the iOS deployment target and platform claims with the Swift iOS 17.0 baseline.
- Removed the backend plugin `uses-material-design` flag.

### Notes
- ONNX backend FFI typedefs still live in this package because moving them to the shared native type layer requires touching the core `runanywhere` package, which is outside this lane's write scope.
