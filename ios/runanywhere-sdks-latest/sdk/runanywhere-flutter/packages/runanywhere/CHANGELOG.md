# Changelog

All notable changes to the RunAnywhere Flutter SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.20.9] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- Version-aligned 0.20.9 release across all RunAnywhere SDKs; dev-analytics config baked into the native core at build time.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- Adopted the canonical 0.20 API contracts and release-native packaging.

### Removed
- Removed deprecated compatibility configuration APIs.

## [0.19.15] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Added request-scoped native cancellation for voice-agent turn streams and aligned generated validation with the canonical IDL.

## [0.19.13] - 2026-05-18

### Removed (BREAKING)
- **VAD callback API**: Removed `RunAnywhereVAD.activityStream`,
  `setSpeechActivityCallback`, `setAudioBufferCallback`, and
  `setStatisticsCallback`. Subscribe to `RunAnywhere.vad.streamVAD(audio)`
  instead. This brings the Flutter VAD surface in line with the Swift
  capability (`RunAnywhere+VAD.swift`).

### Changed
- **v2 architecture**: All public capability surfaces (`RunAnywhere.llm`,
  `.stt`, `.tts`, `.vad`, `.vlm`, `.voice`, `.embeddings`, `.tools`, `.rag`,
  `.models`, `.modelLifecycle`, `.downloads`, `.hardware`, `.solutions`,
  `.lora`) are now namespaced accessors on the `RunAnywhere` static entry
  point, mirroring the Swift/Kotlin/RN/Web SDKs.
- **Lifecycle-owned LLM/STT/TTS/VLM loads**: Model loading now routes
  through commons model lifecycle via the generated proto ABIs
  (`rac_*_lifecycle_proto`). Per-component handle ownership has moved
  into C++.
- **Public Voice `eventStream()`**: Voice agent surface now exposes a
  proto-typed `eventStream` mirroring Swift's `RunAnywhere.voice.events`.
- **Tool-calling session ABIs**: Tool-calling now uses session-based proto
  requests (`rac_tool_calling_*_proto`) for parity with Swift/Kotlin.
- **Plugin loader capability**: New `RunAnywherePluginLoader` surface for
  registering backend plugins (LlamaCpp/ONNX/QHexRT) from Dart.
- **Model lifecycle / registry split**: `RunAnywhereModels` (registry) and
  `RunAnywhereModelLifecycle` (load/unload/current) are now separate
  capability classes.
- **Convenience codegen**: Added generated `*.defaults()` factories
  (`VADConfiguration.defaults()`, `LLMOptions.defaults()`, etc.) so callers
  no longer hand-construct proto messages with magic defaults.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **QHexRT NPU Backend**: Added NPU framework enum support for Qualcomm Hexagon bundles
- **RAG Types**: Extended RAG type definitions for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation

### Changed
- Updated model type definitions to support NPU framework registration

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **API Configuration**: Custom API configuration management for flexible backend routing
- **Keychain Store**: Secure credential storage capabilities via platform keychain
- **Dev Mode**: Development configuration support for local testing and debugging

### Fixed
- **Parameter Piping**: Fixed parameter propagation through SDK layers (#340)
- **Network Layer**: Resolved authentication and dev config networking issues
- **Simulator Scripts**: Fixed build scripts for iOS simulator targets
- **Android Models**: Updated model support handling for Android platform

### Changed
- Updated native binaries (RACommons, RABackendLLAMACPP, RABackendONNX) to latest builds
- Addressed PR #309 review feedback with critical fixes

## [0.15.11] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **iOS**: Updated RACommons.xcframework to v0.1.5 with correct symbol visibility
  - The v0.1.4 xcframework had symbols that became local during linking
  - v0.1.5 xcframework properly exports all symbols as global
  - Combined with `DynamicLibrary.executable()` from 0.15.10, iOS now works correctly

## [0.15.10] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **iOS**: Fixed symbol lookup by using `DynamicLibrary.executable()` instead of `DynamicLibrary.process()`
  - `process()` uses `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` which only finds GLOBAL symbols
  - `executable()` can find both global and LOCAL symbols in the main binary
  - With static linkage, xcframework symbols become local - this is the correct fix

## [0.15.9] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **iOS**: Added linker flags (partial fix, superseded by 0.15.10)

### Important
- **iOS Podfile Configuration Required**: Users must configure their Podfile with `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static` for the SDK to work correctly. See README.md for complete setup instructions.

### Added
- Initial public release on pub.dev
- Core SDK infrastructure with modular backend support
- Event bus for component communication
- Service container for dependency injection
- Native FFI bridge for on-device AI inference
- Audio capture and playback management
