 * HTTP transport registration JNI bridge — Flutter plugin copy.
 *
 * Copy of the entry point the prebuilt `librunanywhere_jni.so` exports:
 *   Java_com_runanywhere_sdk_native_bridge_RunAnywhereBridge_racHttpTransportRegisterOkHttp
 *   Java_com_runanywhere_sdk_native_bridge_RunAnywhereBridge_racHttpTransportUnregisterOkHttp
 *
 * The package + class name are intentionally identical to the Kotlin SDK's
 * `RunAnywhereBridge` because JNI resolves the native methods by the full
 * Java class name. Only the two HTTP transport registration methods are
 * declared here — every other Kotlin SDK bridge method is irrelevant to the
 * Flutter plugin (which talks to the C core through Dart FFI instead).
 *
 * Loads the prebuilt `librunanywhere_jni.so` bundled under
 *   android/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/librunanywhere_jni.so
 * which also dynamically depends on `librac_commons.so` (the transport
 * registry). Calling [racHttpTransportRegisterOkHttp] installs a vtable
 * that routes `rac_http_request_*` through
 * [com.runanywhere.sdk.httptransport.OkHttpHttpTransport] — subsequent
 * HTTP traffic from the SDK flows through OkHttp instead of libcurl.
