# =============================================================================
# Unified SDK build contract. This script builds the Swift SDK against a set
# of native artifacts (XCFrameworks) and produces a sanity-check build result.
#
# The Swift SDK is not shipped as a tarball — SwiftPM consumers reference the
# repo at a git tag. This script's job is to validate that the Swift package
# resolves and compiles with the given natives in place.
#
# USAGE:
#   build-sdk.sh [--mode local|ci] [--natives-from PATH]
#
# OPTIONS:
#   --mode local|ci      Build mode (default: auto-detect from $CI)
#   --natives-from PATH  Directory containing *.xcframework (default: sdk/runanywhere-swift/Binaries/)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   .build/              SwiftPM build directory
#   (no tarball — consumers reference the repo at a tag)
# =============================================================================
