/**
 * @file rac_hybrid_types.h
 * @brief RunAnywhere Commons - Hybrid router shared types.
 *
 * C mirrors of the messages declared in idl/hybrid_router.proto. The router
 * uses a single capability-agnostic set of filter / cascade / rank types;
 * per-capability handles (rac_stt_hybrid_router.h, etc.) wrap these in a
 * typed public API.
 *
 * All enum values are explicit and match the proto wire numbers — Kotlin /
 * Swift / RN bindings pass these as int32 across the FFI and any reorder
 * would silently break them.
