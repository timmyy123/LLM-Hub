/**
 * @file rac_hybrid_device_state.cpp
 * @brief Atomic storage for the cross-SDK device-state vtable.
 *
 * The active vtable pointer lives behind a std::atomic. Set copies the
 * caller's ops into a heap allocation, swaps the pointer atomically,
 * and retires the previous heap slot. Unset swaps back to the static
 * default vtable and retires the previous heap slot.
 *
 * Get-snapshot loads the active pointer once, invokes the three
 * callbacks against it, and packs the result into a value struct so
 * the caller never holds a raw vtable pointer past the snapshot scope.
 *
 * Memory ordering: acquire/release on the pointer swap is sufficient
 * because the ops struct contents are constants once published —
 * bindings never mutate a published struct. Subsequent setters publish
 * a fresh heap allocation rather than editing the live one.
 *
 * Lifecycle: when set/unset is called while a request thread is
 * mid-callback, that thread holds a pointer copy from a prior atomic
 * load — we can't free the previous slot immediately. The previous
 * slot is parked in g_retired; the NEXT set/unset call frees it. This
 * gives in-flight readers a one-generation reprieve. Bindings that
 * need stricter quiescence MUST pair their unset with their own
 * synchronization before releasing the binding-owned user_data (see
 * the @warning in the header).
