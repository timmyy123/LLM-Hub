/**
 * @file vad_threshold_registry.h
 * @brief Internal per-handle mutex registry serializing VAD energy-threshold
 *        get/set/process/restore windows.
 *
 * NOT part of the public C ABI; only `vad_component.cpp` and
 * `rac_vad_stream.cpp` may include this header.
 *
 * Rationale: both the one-shot
 * `rac_vad_component_process_proto` path and the streaming
 * `rac_vad_stream_feed_audio_proto` path implement a get→set(override)→
 * process→restore sequence on the same VAD component handle. Without a
 * shared per-handle mutex, two threads on the same handle (one one-shot,
 * one streaming, or two of either) can interleave their set/restore calls,
 * leaving the persistent energy-threshold drifted to a stale value.
 *
 * The mutex is owned via shared_ptr so callers can release the registry
 * mutex before locking the per-handle mutex (we must not call into the VAD
 * component while holding the registry mutex, which is also taken by the
 * dispatch path); shared_ptr keeps the mutex alive across that gap even
 * if a teardown thread erases the map entry concurrently.
 *
 * `erase_threshold_mutex` is called from
 * `rac_vad_component_destroy` so the map does not grow unbounded across the
 * lifetime of the process.
