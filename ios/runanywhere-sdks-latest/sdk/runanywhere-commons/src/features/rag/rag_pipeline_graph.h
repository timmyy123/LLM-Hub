/**
 * @file rag_pipeline_graph.h
 * @brief RAG query orchestration as a GraphScheduler-driven DAG.
 *
 * Second real consumer of the streaming graph runtime
 * after the unit-test suite. Replaces the old hand-rolled imperative
 * `RAGBackend::query()` step-by-step orchestration with a typed DAG:
 *
 *     Query(string)
 *         → Embed(string -> vector<float>)
 *         → Retrieve(embedding + query -> chunks)
 *         → ContextAssembly(chunks + query -> prompt)
 *         → LLM(prompt -> tokens)
 *
 * The graph is built per query: nodes are created, the scheduler is
 * started, the question is pushed, the input edge is closed, every node
 * drains, the scheduler joins, and tokens are forwarded to the caller's
 * callback as they stream out of the LLM node.
 *
 * Rerank: optional LLM-pointwise stage between Retrieve and ContextAssembly,
 * enabled per query via RAGGraphInputs::rerank. Fused candidates are scored
 * 1-5 for relevance by the same LLM handle used for generation (no
 * cross-encoder — the `RAC_PRIMITIVE_RERANK` primitive / `rerank_ops` vtable
 * slot were removed in plugin ABI v4) and reordered before context assembly.
 * Any failure falls back to the fused order.
