 *
 * Generic component-actor scaffold for a single C++ component (LLM / STT /
 * TTS / VAD / VLM). The variable parts are supplied via [ComponentVTable];
 * this type owns the rest:
 *
 *   - lazy handle creation (one C handle per component instance)
 *   - `isLoaded` proxy across the C ABI
 *   - `loadModel(...)` taking 3 strings, threaded through the vtable slot
 *   - `unload()` (cleanup) and `destroy()`
 *   - kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex provides concurrency safety (Kotlin
 *     does not have a stable actor primitive)
 *   - structured logging keyed by the proto component name
 *
 * VoiceAgent does NOT use this scaffold — its handle type wraps a
 * composite (STT + LLM + TTS + VAD) and create() is async + composite.
 *
 * Kotlin SDK W2-2 mirror of Swift's
 * `Sources/RunAnywhere/Foundation/Bridge/ComponentActor.swift`.
