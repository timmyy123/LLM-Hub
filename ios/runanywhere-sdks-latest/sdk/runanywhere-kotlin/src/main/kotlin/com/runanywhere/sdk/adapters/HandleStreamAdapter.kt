/*
 * HandleStreamAdapter.kt
 *
 * Kotlin port of Swift's `Sources/RunAnywhere/Adapters/HandleStreamAdapter.swift`.
 *
 * Generic `Flow`-based wrapper over a proto-byte streaming C ABI of the
 * shape `(handle, callback, userData) -> int`. Replaces the duplicated
 * fan-out machinery that would otherwise repeat across LLMStreamAdapter
 * and VoiceAgentStreamAdapter (and any future per-handle stream).
 *
 * The C ABI exposes a SINGLE proto-callback slot per handle, so a naive
 * adapter would silently let one collector clobber another. This generic
 * installs ONE C-side registration lazily on the first subscriber and
 * tears it down when the last subscriber detaches, fanning each decoded
 * event out to every active `Flow` collector.
 *
 * Semantics (matched to Swift's HandleStreamAdapter exactly):
 *   * The first subscriber installs one C callback registration.
 *   * Subsequent subscribers fan out from the same registration — all
 *     share the single registered trampoline.
 *   * On the last subscriber unsubscribing the registration is torn
 *     down and the per-handle fan-out is removed from the static map.
 *   * If the caller supplies `isTerminalEvent`, an event satisfying
 *     the predicate finishes every collector and tears down the
 *     registration immediately (the LLM `is_final` semantics). When the
 *     predicate is omitted (the VoiceAgent case) events fan out
 *     forever until consumers detach.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   * Per-handle state is guarded by `synchronized(lock)`. State ops
 *     happen inside both suspend (collector attach/detach) and
 *     non-suspend (C callback trampoline) contexts, so a coroutine
 *     `Mutex` cannot be used uniformly.
 *   * The per-handle registry is a `MutableMap` guarded by its own
 *     monitor — KMP commonMain has no `ConcurrentHashMap`, but the
 *     critical sections are O(1) and contention is low.
 *
 * Public API:
 *     val adapter = HandleStreamAdapter<Long, LLMStreamEvent>(
 *         handle = handle,
 *         streamKey = "llm",
 *         register = { h, cb -> bridge.registerCallback(h, cb) },
 *         unregister = { h, id -> bridge.unregisterCallback(h, id) },
 *         quiesce = { bridge.quiesce() },
 *         decodeEvent = { bytes -> LLMStreamEvent.ADAPTER.decode(bytes) },
 *         isTerminalEvent = { it.is_final },
 *     )
 *     adapter.stream().collect { event -> ... }
 *
 * Cancellation: standard `Flow` cancellation (collector cancelled,
 * `take(N)` completes, etc.) fires `awaitClose`, which detaches the
 * channel. When the last channel detaches the C registration is torn
 * down.

/**
 * Generic Flow wrapper for proto-byte streaming C ABIs that follow the
 * `(handle, callback) -> callbackId` shape.
 *
 * @param Handle Native handle type. Kept abstract so per-component
 *   handle wrappers (`Long` for LLM/VoiceAgent today; future opaque
 *   wrappers tomorrow) can plug in without changing the generic.
 * @param Event Proto event type. Must extend Wire's [Message] so the
 *   adapter can statically narrow the [decodeEvent] return type. The
 *   decode closure itself is injected, mirroring Swift's `Event(serializedBytes:)`
 *   indirection (Wire's `ADAPTER` lives on the companion of each generated
 *   class — Kotlin generics cannot reach it without reflection).
 *
 * @param handle The native handle the C registration targets.
 * @param streamKey Identifier that partitions the global fan-out store
 *   by adapter kind. Two adapter instances that share the same `Handle`
 *   type but call different `register` symbols must use distinct
 *   `streamKey` values; otherwise their fan-outs collide. Pass a stable
 *   string such as `"llm"` or `"voice-agent"`.
 * @param register Closure that installs the C-side callback for [handle].
 *   Must return a non-zero callback id on success or
 *   [INVALID_CALLBACK_ID] (0) on failure.
 * @param unregister Closure that tears down the C-side registration
 *   identified by `callbackId`. Pass a no-op id-less closure if your ABI
 *   uses a NULL-callback re-installation pattern (mirror Swift's
 *   VoiceAgent specialization).
 * @param quiesce Closure that waits for in-flight native callback
 *   dispatches to finish after [unregister] and before collector channels are
 *   closed. Mirrors Swift's HandleStreamAdapter teardown contract.
 * @param decodeEvent Closure that parses one proto-byte payload into
 *   an [Event]. Typically `{ bytes -> Event.ADAPTER.decode(bytes) }`.
 * @param isTerminalEvent Optional predicate that classifies an event
 *   as terminal. When non-null and an event satisfies it, every
 *   collector is closed and the C registration is torn down. Omit to
 *   get pure fan-out semantics (events flow until subscribers detach).
