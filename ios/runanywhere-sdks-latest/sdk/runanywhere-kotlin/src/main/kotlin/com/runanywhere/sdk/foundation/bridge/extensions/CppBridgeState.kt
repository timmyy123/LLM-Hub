 * State bridge extension for C++ interop.
 *
 * Two concerns live in this object:
 *
 *  1. Centralised SDK runtime gate flags — the four volatile booleans
 *     that `CppBridge` uses to gate Phase 1 / Phase 2 initialisation.
 *     Owning them here lets future refactors split the coordinator
 *     (`CppBridge`) from the shared mutable state without churning every
 *     consumer call site.
 *
 *  2. Persisted backend state accessors — environment, base URL, API
 *     key, device ID, device-registration flag, plus init/shutdown.
 *     These read/write the global `rac_sdk_state` (non-auth state) and
 *     `rac_auth_manager` (auth state) singletons via the `racState*` /
 *     `racAuth*` JNI thunks.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS source of truth:
 *   sdk/runanywhere-swift/Sources/RunAnywhere/Foundation/Bridge/Extensions/
 *     CppBridge+State.swift
 *
 * This object is the canonical owner of the four runtime gate flags
 * (`isInitialized`, `servicesInitialized`, `servicesInitializing`,
 * `nativeLibraryLoaded`). `CppBridge.kt` no longer holds private
 * duplicates — its public properties delegate to the volatiles below
 * and writes inside `CppBridge.initialize()` /
 * `CppBridge.completeServicesInitialization()` /
 * `CppBridge.shutdownSuspending()` mutate this object directly under
 * the coordinator's `synchronized(lock)` guards.

 *
 * Thread safety: all in-memory writes use `@Volatile`. Coordination

 * still be wrapped in a synchronised block by the caller — the same
