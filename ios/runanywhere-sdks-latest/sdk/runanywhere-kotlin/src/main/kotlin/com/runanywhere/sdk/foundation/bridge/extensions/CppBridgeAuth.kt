/*
 * CppBridge+Auth.kt — RunAnywhere SDK
 *
 * This file was previously a ~150 LOC HTTP-transport adapter built on
 * HttpURLConnection that forwarded request/response bodies to the
 * matching rac_auth_* C ABI. HTTP now flows through the registered OkHttp
 * transport behind commons' `rac_http_client_*` ABI. Kotlin owns no separate
 * auth transport — the whole round-trip (request build → POST → response
 * parse → state update) happens in native code.
 *
 * SDKs still initialize secure storage and expose auth state accessors here;
 * network sequencing lives in commons via CppBridgeSdkInit.
