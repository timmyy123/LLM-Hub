 * JNI bridge for the cloud-STT backend PLUGIN.
 *
 * cloud is a real engine plugin (mirrors onnx / llamacpp): these native
 * methods register the "cloud" engine with the unified plugin registry so
 * it is routable via `rac_plugin_route(RAC_PRIMITIVE_TRANSCRIBE,
 * hint="cloud")`. The concrete HTTP provider (e.g. "sarvam") is carried
 * in the create config (config_json["provider"]), not as a distinct engine.
 * Service creation no longer goes through a bespoke per-engine factory — the
 * hybrid router creates the online side via
 * `RunAnywhereBridge.racSttHybridRouterCreateService("cloud", …)` which
 * resolves the routed engine's `stt_ops->create` exactly like the offline
 * (sherpa) side.
 *
 * The cloud JNI TU is linked into the commons JNI shared library
 * (librunanywhere_jni.so), so loading the commons library via
 * [RunAnywhereBridge.ensureNativeLibraryLoaded] also resolves these symbols —
 * no separate System.loadLibrary is required.
