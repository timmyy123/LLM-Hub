/**
 * StorageProvider.ts
 *
 * Uniform interface for persistent model storage backends.
 * On the Web platform we ship three concrete providers:
 *   - `fsAccess`   — File System Access API (user picked a directory)
 *   - `opfs`       — Origin Private File System (default persistent fallback)
 *   - `memory`     — No persistent model storage; downloads are unavailable
 *                    because independent backend WASMs cannot share MEMFS
 *
 * Mirrors the storage-backend contract so that other platforms (Swift / Kotlin /
 * Flutter / RN) can implement their analogue under a shared API name. Today
 * the Web SDK writes downloaded models via the C++ commons download
 * orchestrator; LocalFileStorage is the only JS-side persistent adapter wired
 * in V2. This interface exposes a stable way for application code (and other
 * platforms) to reason about which backend is active without leaking
 * implementation details.
 *
 * This file intentionally has no runtime dependencies on the Emscripten module
 * — it is a shape definition only. Concrete providers attach via
 * `RunAnywhere.storage.setProvider(...)`.
