# Contract:
#   RAC_BUILD_MODE=ci    ← running in GitHub Actions (or any CI environment
#                           that sets $CI=true)
#   RAC_BUILD_MODE=local ← developer machine
#
# Behavior that should differ between modes:
#   local: tolerant of missing deps, uses cache, prints hints
#   ci:    strict toolchain checks, no cache warmup, fail fast
#
# Callers can force a mode by setting RAC_BUILD_MODE before sourcing this.
