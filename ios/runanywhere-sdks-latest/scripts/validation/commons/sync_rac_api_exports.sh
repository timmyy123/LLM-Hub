# sync_rac_api_exports.sh
#
# Companion to check_rac_api_exports.sh. Regenerates the symbols
# section of sdk/runanywhere-commons/exports/RACommons.exports by
# parsing every RAC_API-decorated declaration under
# sdk/runanywhere-commons/include/rac/**/*.h and appending any newly
# discovered symbols to the curated exports list.
#
# Existing content (comment headers + previously-listed symbols) is
# preserved verbatim. Only NET-NEW symbols are appended under a new
# "AUTO-SYNC" section. The script never rewrites or reorders existing
# entries — running it multiple times is idempotent.
#
# Symbols that are deliberately excluded (backend-conditional entry
# points and stale decls) are listed in the EXCLUDE set below and are
# never appended. To exclude additional symbols, add them to that set.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/validation/commons/sync_rac_api_exports.sh           # append new symbols
#   scripts/validation/commons/sync_rac_api_exports.sh --check   # alias for
#                                                       # check_rac_api_exports.sh --strict
#
# After running, re-run check_rac_api_exports.sh --strict to confirm
# drift is reduced to the deliberately-excluded set.
