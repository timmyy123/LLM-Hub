#
# Drift gate: parse every RAC_API-decorated declaration under
# sdk/runanywhere-commons/include/rac/**/*.h, parse the curated exports list at
# sdk/runanywhere-commons/exports/RACommons.exports, and report any public
# RAC_API symbol missing from the exports list.
#
# Default behavior: prints a non-zero-exit report listing the drift but is
# advisory-only when invoked without `--strict`. Many of the currently
# "missing" symbols are candidates for RAC_API stripping (internalization)
# rather than additions to the exports list — that cleanup is a follow-up.
# Once internalization is done, the script should be
# wired as `--strict` into `run_commons_proto_checks.sh`.
#
# Usage:
#   check_rac_api_exports.sh           # report only, always exits 0 on drift
#   check_rac_api_exports.sh --strict  # exit 1 on drift (CI gate)
#
# To update: either add the new symbol to exports/RACommons.exports with the
# leading underscore (Apple linker convention) OR strip RAC_API from the
# declaration if the function is meant to be commons-internal.
