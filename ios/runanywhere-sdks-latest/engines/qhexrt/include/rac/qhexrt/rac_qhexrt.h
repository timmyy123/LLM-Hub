 * v75/v79/v81 applicability and HF-auth requirements. It skips private rows

 * later model lifecycle work to backend-neutral commons primitives.

 * Inputs are borrowed for the call. The caller initializes @p out_model with
 * rac_proto_buffer_init() and frees it with rac_proto_buffer_free(). A normal
 * unsupported/ineligible outcome returns RAC_SUCCESS, sets
 * @p out_registered to RAC_FALSE, and writes an empty success buffer.
