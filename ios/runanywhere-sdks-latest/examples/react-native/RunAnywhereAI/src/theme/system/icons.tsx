/**
 * App icon set — Lucide icons, wrapped so screens reference semantic names
 * instead of importing glyphs directly. Defaults: 24px, stroke width 2; `color`
 * falls through to the caller (Lucide defaults to currentColor when unset).
 *
 * Grows as screens migrate off react-native-vector-icons; once nothing imports
 * Ionicons, that dependency is removed in one step. Backed by react-native-svg.
