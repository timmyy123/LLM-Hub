/**
 * @file rac_hybrid_device_state.h
 * @brief Cross-SDK host device-state vtable for the hybrid router.
 *
 * Each platform binding (Kotlin, Swift, Flutter, RN, Web) populates this
 * vtable once at SDK init with native callbacks that report whether the
 * host has internet, current battery %, and whether the device is
 * thermally throttled.
 *
 * The native hybrid router consults this vtable (via
 * rac_hybrid_get_device_state_snapshot) on every generate() call to
 * evaluate the NETWORK / Battery filters. Bindings do NOT pass these
 * fields in the per-request routing context — the proto context message
 * is currently empty and reserved for future per-call hints.
 *
 * Thread-safety: rac_hybrid_set_device_state can be called from any
 * thread; the active vtable is swapped atomically. Callbacks themselves
 * may be invoked concurrently from request threads, so implementations
 * must be reentrant.
 *
 * Lifecycle: callbacks are invoked while the binding's user_data is
 * alive. Bindings must call rac_hybrid_set_device_state(NULL) to detach
 * before freeing their user_data — see the @warning note on the setter.
