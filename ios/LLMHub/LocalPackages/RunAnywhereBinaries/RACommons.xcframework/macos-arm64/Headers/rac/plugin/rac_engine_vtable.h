/**
 * @file rac_engine_vtable.h
 * @brief Unified engine plugin vtable.
 *
 * A single vtable type replaces the per-domain `rac_llm_service_ops_t`,
 * `rac_stt_service_ops_t`, `rac_tts_service_ops_t`, … structs. Every engine
 * backend (llama.cpp, ONNX, sherpa, QHexRT, …)
 * populates one of these. Primitives the engine does NOT serve leave the
 * corresponding op-struct pointer NULL; the registry treats NULL as "engine
 * does not support this primitive" and returns `RAC_ERROR_CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED`.
 *
 * ABI contract:
 *   - `metadata.abi_version` MUST equal `RAC_PLUGIN_API_VERSION` at load time.
 *     Mismatch rejects the plugin with `RAC_ERROR_ABI_VERSION_MISMATCH`.
 *   - Primitive slot pointers (llm_ops, stt_ops, …) are stable; new primitives
 *     go into one of the 10 reserved slots at the end of the struct (enforced
 *     by `RAC_PRIMITIVE_RESERVED_{9..18}` in `rac_primitive.h`).
 *   - `capability_check` is called once after ABI version validation but
 *     before the plugin is added to the registry; returning non-zero rejects
 *     the plugin without logging it as an error (e.g. for Metal-only engines
 *     on Linux).

 * was never routable. It has no vtable slot and no table row.

 *   1. Add one X(...) row here (and the matching `const struct ..._ops*` slot
 *      promoted from a reserved slot in the struct above).
 *   2. Promote the corresponding `RAC_PRIMITIVE_RESERVED_*` enumerator in
 *      rac_primitive.h to the named primitive.
